## 📋 Introduction
AACR-Bench is a multi-lingual, repository-level context-aware code review benchmark dataset designed to evaluate the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in automated code review tasks. The dataset contains 200 real Pull Requests from 50 active open-source projects, covering 10 mainstream programming languages. Each instance not only includes code changes but also preserves comprehensive repository context, faithfully reproducing the entire code review process. Through human-LLM collaborative review and multi-round expert annotation, we ensure high-quality and comprehensive data.

### Main Applications
+ Evaluating code review models' issue detection capabilities
+ Assessing the quality and feasibility of review suggestions
+ Testing cross-language and cross-project generalization abilities
+ Fine-grained analysis of context-awareness capabilities

## ✨ Core Features
### 🌐 Multi-language Coverage
Covers 10 mainstream programming languages: Python, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Rust, C++, C#, Ruby, PHP

### 📁 Repository-level Context
+ Preserves complete project structure and dependency information
+ Supports cross-file reference analysis

### 🤖 Human Expert + LLM Enhanced Annotation
+ Human expert initial review + systematic LLM supplementation
+ Identifies subtle issues and potential improvements
+ Multi-round expert review ensures comment quality

### 📊 Comprehensive Evaluation Metrics
+ **Precision**: Comment quality and line-level positioning accuracy
+ **Recall**: Completeness of issue discovery
+ **Noise Rate**: Invalid comment identification
+ **Multi-dimensional Analysis**: Support for language and issue type statistics

## 📏 Evaluation Metrics
We employ a multi-dimensional metric system to comprehensively evaluate code review model performance. For complete metric definitions, calculation methods, and per-language statistics, please refer to [docs/METRICS.md](docs/METRICS.md).

### Core Metrics
| Metric | Description | Formula |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Precision** | Proportion of valid comments generated by the model | Valid matches / Total generated |
| **Recall** | Ability to discover issues in the annotation set | Valid matches / Valid in dataset |
| **Line Precision** | Ability to precisely locate code lines | Line matches / Total generated |
| **Noise Rate** | Proportion of invalid or incorrect comments | Unmatched / Total generated |


### Benchmark Results (TBD)
| Model | Precision | Recall | Line Precision | Noise Rate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Qwen |  |  |  |  |
| Claude-4 |  |  |  |  |
| Deepseek |  |  |  |  |
